printingcode
============
Printing Code is a graduate course taught at the Interactive Telecommunications Program at New York University. In this course students explore the use of computational techniques to produce physical prints, focusing on the intersection between graphic design and code. Class time will be divided between exploring design topics like colors, grids and typefaces, and applying these towards computational topics like randomization, repetition, transformation and generative form.
